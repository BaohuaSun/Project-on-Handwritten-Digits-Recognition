For people who is interested in the full logic flow of the whole project, you can start from the beginning of the directory step by step.

For those who just want to see the codes written by me, you can directly go to the directory shown below:
Project-on-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition/2.-Reading-Data/2.3.-Data-Reading-functions-written-in-Matlab/Functions-for-Reading-Data/ 
You will see matlab codes for reading files there. One important part of this project is to read the data in format, in order to be ready to feed different algorithms.

Or, you can go to the directory of 
Project-on-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition/3.-Algorithms-Used
to see how we implement different algorithms on the data.

Because this project is based on a particular data set of handwritten digits, the directories before   "2.3.-Data-Reading-functions-written-in-Matlab"
is mainly detailed introduction of the data set and the introductions on how we preprocessed the data, without any code. If you are interested in my coding and approaching, you can skip the first few sections.


In this porject, we have implemented eight different pattern recognition algorithms for classification of handwritten digits. Data sets are obtained from UCI machine learning repository, from which three different methods are introduced to exact the features.  For each algorithm, we try it on all the three sets of features and setup several different configurations for the  feasible features. At the end of the report, we compare the performance of the algorithms we used.   Keywords: Optical Handwritten Digits Recognition, KNN, Gaussian, LBG-VQ, Kernel Perception, Neural Network, Nearest Group, LDA,SVM.
