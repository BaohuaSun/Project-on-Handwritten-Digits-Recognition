# Project-on-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
In this porject, we have implemented eight different pattern recognition algorithms for classification of handwritten digits. Data sets are obtained from UCI machine learning repository, from which three different methods are introduced to exact the features.  For each algorithm, we try it on all the three sets of features and setup several different configurations for the  feasible features. At the end of the report, we compare the performance of the algorithms we used.   Keywords: Optical Handwritten Digits Recognition, KNN, Gaussian, LBG-VQ, Kernel Perception, Neural Network, Nearest Group, LDA,SVM.
